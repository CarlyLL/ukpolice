ukpolice is an R package that facilitates retrieving data from the [UK police database.](https://data.police.uk/)

This package is in a very beta stage, and I'm still learning a lot about APIs!

Installation
============

Install from GitHub

``` r

#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njtierney/ukpolice")
```

Usage
=====

`get_neighbourhoods`, retrieves a list of neighbourhoods for a force, <https://data.police.uk/docs/method/neighbourhoods/>

This returns a tibble with columns `id` and `name`.

``` r

library(ukpolice)
get_neighbourhoods("leicestershire")
#> No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.
#> # A tibble: 67 Ã— 2
#>       id                           name
#>    <chr>                          <chr>
#> 1   NC04                    City Centre
#> 2   NC66               Cultural Quarter
#> 3   NC67                      Riverside
#> 4   NC68                 Clarendon Park
#> 5   NE09                 Belgrave South
#> 6   NE10                 Belgrave North
#> 7   NE11                    Rushey Mead
#> 8   NE12                    Humberstone
#> 9   NE13 Northfields, Tailby and Morton
#> 10  NE14                     Thurncourt
#> # ... with 57 more rows
```

-   `id` is a Police force specific team identifier, (note that this identifier is not unique and may also be used by a different force).
-   `name` is the name for the neighbourhood.
