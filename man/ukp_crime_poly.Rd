\usage{
ukp_crime_poly(poly, date = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{poly}{The lat/lng pairs which define the boundary of the custom area. If a custom area contains more than 10,000 crimes, the API will return a 503 status code. The poly parameter is formatted in lat/lng pairs, separated by colons: [lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]. The first and last coordinates need not be the same â€” they will be joined by a straight line once the request is made.}

\item{date, }{Optional. (YYY-MM), limit results to a specific month. The latest month will be shown by default. e.g. date = "2013-01"}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods. For example, verbose option can be added with ukp_api("call", config = httr::verbose()). See more in ?httr::GET documentation (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/) and (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/quickstart.html).}
