# ukpolice 0.0.0.9001 (2016-10-26)

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* changed all functions to have prefix `ukp_`, so `get_neighbourhoods` changed to `ukp_neighbourhood`, and `ukpolice_api` changed to `ukp_api`, as suggested by @sckott in [issue #6](https://github.com/njtierney/ukpolice/issues/6).
* added function `ukp_neighbourhood_force`, to find associated neighbourhood forcename and neighbourhood ID.
* added `...` option in `ukp_api`, to facilitate debugging, as suggested by @sckott in [issue #7](https://github.com/njtierney/ukpolice/issues/7)
