ukpolice is an R package that facilitates retrieving data from the [UK police database.](https://data.police.uk/)

This package is under construction.

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

Currently the only function is `get_neighbourhoods`, which retrieves a list of neighbourhoods for a force, https://data.police.uk/docs/method/neighbourhoods/

This returns a tibble with columns id and name. 

```{r}

library(ukpolice)
get_neighbourhoods("leicestershire")

```

id is a Police force specific team identifier, note that this identifier is not unique and may also be used by a different force. Name is the name for the neighbourhood
